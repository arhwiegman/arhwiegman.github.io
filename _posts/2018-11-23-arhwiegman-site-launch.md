Welcome folks. Today I started my website, which is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), I can use Markdown to author my posts. I used this [demo ](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) to guide me through the start up, which was quite painless. From time to time I will put up blogposts and research findings.

Enjoy,

Adrian
