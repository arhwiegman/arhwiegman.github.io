In June 2020 I participated in a the American Ecological Engineering Society's [virtual poster symposium](https://2020aeesposters.com/). I was selected as a finalist and finished in second place! You can view my poster presentation below. There were many interesting posters, you can watch the presentations [here](https://2020aeesposters.com/)!
