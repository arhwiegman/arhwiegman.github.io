I over the winter interviewed for a documentary produced by Vince Frank at Peregrine Productions LLC, "Doing Our Part: A Commitment to Clean Water". Doing Our Part aired on Vermont PBS Over the summer in 2020. The video is raises awareness about the water quality benefits of wetlands in Vermont and ongoing wetland restoration and conservation efforts in the LaPlatte River.

It was nice to see so many of my colleagues involved in Vermont wetland restoration featured in the film. I show up in minute 27 and talk about UVMs efforts to quantify phosphorus retention benefits of restoration. I have to admit, this was my first video interview since high school and I was pretty nervous. Any way, Vince did a great job producing the film, check it out!
