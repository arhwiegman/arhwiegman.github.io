Back in spring 2019 I was part of a group of UVM graduate students that spend weeks discussing the competing objectives of sustaining the agricultural economy and maintaining water quality in Lake Champlain. We published a white paper with a comprehensive plan for payment for ecosystem services that would pay farmers that adopted best management practices water quality. This approach has picked up interest in the state and I am interested to see where it leads in the future.
