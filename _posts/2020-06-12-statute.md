title: "Vermont Wetlands Statute"
date: 2020-06-12

In 2019 a committee was established to examine changes to the Vermont wetland statute. Among the potential changes would be expansions to agricultural exemptions in wetlands. I gave testimony on the importance of wetlands and their ecosystem services and recommended that the committee not make any changes that would further erode Vermont's natural wetlands. The committee ultimately decided not to change the wetland rules that would dismantle wetland protections, this was a major win for water quality and wildlife! My testimony is available <a href="https://arhwiegman.github.io/blog/assets/W_Adrian_Wiegman_Testimony_11-20-2019.pdf">here</a>.
