Hey folks, I it has been a while since I have posted. But I will be posting more frequently now. I have a couple exiting updates to share.

## Payment For Ecosystem Services White Paper

Back in spring 2019 I was part of a group of UVM graduate students that spend weeks discussing the competing objectives of sustaining the agricultural economy and maintaining water quality in Lake Champlain. We published a white paper with a comprehensive plan for payment for ecosystem services that would pay farmers that adopted best management practices water quality. This approach has picked up interest in the state and I am interested to see where it leads in the future. You can read this white paper [here]()

## Vermont Wetlands Statute

In 2019 a committee was established to examine changes to the Vermont wetland statute. Among the potential changes would be expansions to agricultural exemptions in wetlands. I gave testimony on the importance of wetlands and their ecosystem services and recommended that the committee not make any changes that would further erode Vermont's natural wetlands. The committee ultimately decided not to change the wetland rules that would dismantle wetland protections, this was a major win for water quality and wildlife! My testimony is available [here]().

## Ecological Engineering Virtual Poster Symposium

In June 2020 I participated in a the American Ecological Engineering Society's [virtual poster symposium](https://2020aeesposters.com/). I was selected as a finalist and finished in second place! You can view my poster presentation below. There were many interesting posters, you can watch the presentations [here](https://2020aeesposters.com/)!
